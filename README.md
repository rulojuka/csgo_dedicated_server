# csgo_dedicated_server
My journey to create a professional-configurated csgo dedicated server

Expected features:

- Fully automated deploy: no more than 1 enter should be pressed for the server to be deployed
- Cloud-ready: This should be easily-deployed on DigitalOcean, AWS or similar
- Decent admin configuration: The admin should not have the hardest time of his life when administering a match.
- Some template configurations: There should be some templates like competitive.cfg, switchTeams.cfg to help admins

Nice features to have:

- Some documentation of DigitalOcean/AWS/etc machine configurations that would run the server smoothly
- A fully automated bot (.switch, .stay, .pause, etc)
